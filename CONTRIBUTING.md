    ```
3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Verify local setup**:
    Run tests to ensure everything is correct:

## Code Quality Standards

- All async operations must include structured try-catch error boundary handling.
- Enforce the unified API JSON Contract: `{ success, data, error }`.
- Maintain clean, modular components under `src/components/` and server helpers under `src/lib/`.
- All tests must mock external network calls (such as Groq or Maps APIs).
